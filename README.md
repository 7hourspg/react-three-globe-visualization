# Interactive 3D Globe Visualization

This project is an interactive 3D globe visualization built with React, Three.js, and Vite. It features a realistic globe that users can rotate and zoom in/out using the mouse. The globe is textured with a day-night cycle, giving it a realistic appearance. 

The project also includes data visualization features, with data points plotted on the globe based on real-world coordinates.
